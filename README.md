# COVID-19 Visualization Project

## Overview
This project aims to visualize COVID-19 cases in India using Python and various libraries such as Seaborn, Folium, and Matplotlib. The project includes plots of bar charts, maps, and graphs to represent the spread and distribution of COVID-19 cases across different states in India.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Folium
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ## Usage
1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `covid_visualization.ipynb` to see the visualizations.
